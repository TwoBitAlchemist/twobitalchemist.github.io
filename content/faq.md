# Frequently Asked Questions

## Six Cats?!

We didn't originally plan to have this many. Once we bought our first house and got out from under the common landlord restriction of only 2 animals, we adopted a 3rd, then a 4th. We really thought Moka tied the family together and 4 was a great number -- but then our neighbor showed up with two flea-bitten kittens and his sister and he both had no room for them.

## Why are most of your cats named after coffee?

Because my sister objected after our second cat, Tilly, wasn't named after coffee the way our first cat, Cappuccino, is.

## Why are only five of your cats named after coffee?

Because my sister objected *after* our second cat, Tilly, wasn't named after coffee the way our first cat, Cappuccino, is.

## Who are you people?

My name is Kevin and I'm a software engineer. My wife Alison and I live in Southern Illinois with six cats.
