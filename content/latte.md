## Backstory

Long after we were content with the number of cats we had and didn't expect any more, our neighbor showed up while we were letting some of our cats (who are all indoor cats) play in our fenced-in backyard under our supervision. The neighbor had found two very, very flea-infested but friendly kittens and didn't know what to do with them. It was getting cold. We brought them in right away and gave them flea baths in the sink with a ring of Dawn around their necks. After drying them off, they immediately began to explore. We nursed them back to health, got them medicine, and went through the process of getting them vaccinated, chipped, and spayed (something the shelter had taken care of for us on the previous 3 adoptions).

Latte looks bigger than her sister, and due to this and her extreme protectiveness when they first arrived, we thought for sure she was CB's big brother. We were shocked at the vet to learn that not only is Latte female, she's all fluff! At all of their appointments, Latte tended to be just a smidge (usually a half a pound) lighter than her twin sister. Another contrast is their attitude: while CB explores, Latte is content to lounge and turn into a puddle. Even among cats, Latte's floppiness and resemblance to a liquid is legendary. Beware, though, as she will demand a bit of tribute from everything you eat or drink.
