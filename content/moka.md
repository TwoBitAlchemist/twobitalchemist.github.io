## Backstory

We went to a different shelter than usual to look for a fourth cat, and found there an open cat colony living in a single large room filled with food, toys, and a decent amount of natural light. While we were mingling with the many cats, I noticed a big fluffy cat lazily napping on a cat tower in a corner I had not seen. I couldn't resist scritching his fluffy cheeks for a second before joining my wife to talk about another cat. After walking over, I heard an unexpectedly high-pitched but inviting meow behind me, and was surprised to turn around and see this cat had followed me, expecting more pets. Jasper, as he was then known, came home with us that day, and we signed saying he would be "loved and spoiled", a mantra we have repeated to him many times while nuzzling his lustrous, ample coat.

To my surprise, when we got home, Moka would often run from me and took weeks to warm back up. We had learned that Moka lived under a porch, fed by the house's owner and neighbors when they were away. But then, the house's owner moved, and construction began. A concerned neighbor brought Jasper and the other kittens to the shelter where we met them. Moka may have some nascent fears of bearded men, but he still loves scritches, and beware! Petting Moka is a time commitment, and he may follow you to hold you accountable for it, at any time of day or night.
