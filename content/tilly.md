## Backstory

One morning, the lady opening up the local humane society pulled up, and someone had donated a cat carrier, or so she thought. She went to get it from on top of the trash can and was shocked to find a beautiful, fully declawed tortie inside. Despite this, Tilly is very friendly and trusting of humans. She loves laps and sleeping on top of people, and makes a unique form of biscuits that uses a 4-paw kneading technique while straddling a human forearm. If you're lucky, she may also demonstrate "love circles" for you -- if Tilly walks all the way around you, especially more than once, well, you're a very special person indeed.
