<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>Long after we were content with the number of cats we had and didn't expect any more, our neighbor showed up while we were letting some of our cats (who are all indoor cats) play in our fenced-in backyard under our supervision. The neighbor had found two very, very flea-infested but friendly kittens and didn't know what to do with them. It was getting cold. We brought them in right away and gave them flea baths in the sink with a ring of Dawn around their necks. After drying them off, they immediately began to explore. We nursed them back to health, got them medicine, and went through the process of getting them vaccinated, chipped, and spayed (something the shelter had taken care of for us ont he previous 3 adoptions).</p>
<p>CB has always been a little bit smaller than Latte, and, despite having fewer fleas at first, seemed sicklier when she first arrived. I shudder to think what happened to their mother or the rest of their litter, and obviously Latte did too, because she was very protective. CB has always been leaner and more curious and active than her twin sister, and loves to come make biscuits on you when you first go to bed. If you pet her back during this time, she will reward you with some drool.</p>                </article>
